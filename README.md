Final Project Description 

Design and integrate a system with multiple function by using LPC1114 microcontroller in C language. The four functions are: 
A) Calculator, B) Temperature measurement, C) Square wave generator and SPI control of potentiometer and D) Reset. 
It will demonstrate the correct use of timers, UART, SPI and LM35. 


Main functions that it has: 
-	The language used is C. 
-	The phone keyboard and the keypad can be alternatively used at any moment. For example, one number can be pressed from the keypad and the next number can be enter by the phone.
-	A main menu should will be display at the beginning to inform the user of the different functions that the system has: A: Calculator, B: Temperature, C: DDS and gain, *: Reset. The buttons for the different tasks are the ones assigned on the main menu. 
-	The Bluetooth is activated it when the system is powered.
-	Everything that shows in the LCD, it should be show in the phone screen.
-	The * reset button can be used an any point of the operation of the system. 
-	The column pins of the keypad should be shared with the LCD pins (hardware).
